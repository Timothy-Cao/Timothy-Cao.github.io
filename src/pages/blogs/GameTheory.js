          Prime Climb is a math-based board game where the goal is to move two
          pieces from 0 to exactly 101 before other players. Players roll two
          dice (numbered 1 to 10) and use the basic 4 operations to move their pieces. Only natural number results are allowed.

    title: "Naive Approach 1: Greedy Algorithm - Sum-max",
    description: (
      <>
        <Typography variant="body2" style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
          A common beginner strategy is to maximize the sum of their pieces
          every turn. This usually involves multiplying until further
          multiplication exceeds 101, followed by additions to reach exactly
          101. Subtraction is often used when nearing the goal.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
          However, this approach has a significant flaw: it doesn't consider
          future positioning. Entering certain ranges, like 51â€“80, can make it
          harder to progress in subsequent turns.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
          By keeping pieces in more flexible positions, like 30 and 50, players
          have higher probabilities of moving efficiently. For example:
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
          If one piece is at 30 and the other at 50, rolling a 2 or 3 on one of
          the dice can immediately advance a piece to the 90s. The probability
          of rolling a 2 or 3 on either die is approximately 36%. This makes the
          strategy over twice as efficient as simply maximizing sums.

    title: "Naive Approach 2: Lookahead Sum-max",
    description: (
      <>
        <Typography variant="body2" style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
          Another naive strategy is to improve upon sum-max by considering the
          next move. However, this approach is still limited as it often fails
          to account for long-term positioning.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" style={{ marginBottom: "16px" }}>
          A more advanced strategy would involve evaluating multiple turns and
          considering both pieces' positions and probabilities.
