                Hi! I'm Timothy Cao. Iâ€™m 25 years old and grew up in Toronto, 
                Canada. My MBTI flip flops between INTP and ENFP. I'm often recognized
                in the crowd by the bounciness of my walk and the persistent presence of 
                a backpack. 
              </p>
                <br />
              <p>
                To stay fit I usually gravitate towards raquet sports and rock climbing although I enjoy all sports. My hobbies also include composition, piano, boardgames and videogames. I love a good discussion in philosophy, STEM or anything related to my hobbies but I most of all I love to learn about other's experiences and mastery. 
                <br />
                Oh yeah, and back in Canada, I have a pet rabbit. Pudding is of unknown age but she hates vacuums and she's a lil chonker. (4 kg)

                My professional journey started in highschool where I worked in a pharmacy and as a math tutor. I graduated from the University of Waterloo and received my BCS in 2023. During my university internships, I've worked as a software engineer in the government, pre-seed startups, big tech companies and augmented reality companies.

              <p>
                After graduation I've joined a Canadian Startup for a few years, then freelanced for a Real Estate Platform. Today I'm working at Bytedance in California in security engineering.
