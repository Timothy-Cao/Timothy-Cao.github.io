                Hi! I'm Timothy Cao. Iâ€™m 25 years old and grew up in Toronto, 
                Canada. My MBTI flip flops between INTP and ENFP. I'm often recognized
                in the crowd by the bounciness of my walk and the persistent presence of 
                a backpack. 
                
                <br />

                To stay fit I usually gravitate towards raquet sports and rock climbing although I enjoy all sports. My hobbies also include composition, piano, boardgames and videogames. I love a good discussion in philosophy, STEM or anything related to my hobbies but I most of all I love to learn about other's experiences and mastery. 
                
              <br />
                Oh yeah, and back in Canada, I have a pet rabbit. Shes a lil chonker. (4 kg)

              <img
                src="/assets/media/about/waterloo.png"
                alt="University of Waterloo"
                className="rounded-md shadow-md mb-4 w-full"
                style={{
                  maxHeight: "300px",
                  objectFit: "cover",
                  objectPosition: "center",
                }}
              />
              <p>
                I attended the University of Waterloo and received my BCS in
                2023. During my university years, I've interned at various
                companies in technical positions.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                In 2019, I interned in Quality Assurance for the government,
                where I performed regression and load tests. Later, I entered
                the field of software engineering for the first time at eSight,
                an AR company focused on assisting the visually impaired, where
                I worked on low-level programming with embedded systems.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                I also gained experience working on software at scale for a
                fleet management company and created dev tools for a
                safety-critical graphics company.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                After graduation, I returned to an internship at a startup as a
                Technical Lead. Here, I led the development and aided the design
                of Tandem Experiences' App. Subsequently, I worked as a
                contractor and freelancer in fields as data annotation and real
                estate dashboard development.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                My experiences across a range of company sizes have taught me to
                understand how code impacts systems at scale while also taking
                ownership of proportionally large deliverables through multiple
                rounds of feedback. My backend work sharpened my skills in
                creating API endpoints, and my frontend roles enhanced my React
                proficiency and attention to design.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Before university, I had worked in a pharmacy and as a math
                tutor, which provided me with transferable people skills that
                have improved my technical communication with customers and
                colleagues in a professional setting.
